# cs340-Client-Server-Development

In this project, I learned how to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by separating database operations into a dedicated CRUD Python module. By encapsulating the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions inside the AnimalShelter class, I was able to reuse the same clean interface across the dashboard widgets in Project Two. This modular design made the code easier to test, debug, and extend without rewriting logic in multiple places. The advantage of working in this way was that once the database connection and CRUD methods were established, the dashboard could call them directly to retrieve or modify data. In the future, this same CRUD module could be adapted for different datasets or expanded with more advanced queries, providing a strong, reusable foundation for new projects.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and focusing on how each part supports the larger system. With Grazioso Salvareâ€™s request, I first analyzed the database requirements, then built a structured CRUD module, and finally connected it to the dashboard interface. Compared to earlier assignments where I focused more on isolated code snippets, this project required designing an end-to-end solution with real client needs in mind. Going forward, I would continue to use modular design, careful requirement analysis, and incremental testing to create databases that meet diverse client requests. Overall, computer scientists create solutions that allow organizations to manage and analyze data more effectively, and my work on this project demonstrates how a well-structured database and interactive dashboard can help a company like Grazioso Salvare make better decisions in rescue operations.
